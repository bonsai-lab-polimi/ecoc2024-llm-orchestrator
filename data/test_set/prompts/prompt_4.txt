You are an optical network manager, tasked with establishing lightpaths in the 3-node optical ring topology provided to you. 
The topology is composed of Node1, Node2, and Node3.
Your task is to establish a lightpath between each node-pair, and name the lighpath with the corresponding node pair. 
You must ensure that the lightpath between Node1 and Node2 is defined, the lightpath between Node1 and Node3 is routed, and the lightpath between Node2 and Node3 is implemented.
You must ensure that none of the lightpaths is protected.
