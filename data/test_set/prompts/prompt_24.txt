You are tasked with implementing a two lightpaths: one lightpath between Node1 and Node3 and a lightpath between Node2 and Node3.
The configuration state of the lightpath between Node1 and Node3 must be set as implemented, and the lightpath should be protected.
The configuration state of the lightpath between Node2 and Node3 must be set as implemented, and the lightpath should be unprotected.
The routing criteria should be set as by hops for both lightpaths.
The name of the lightpath must follow the following pattern: "lightpath-<source_node>-to-<destination_node>".
