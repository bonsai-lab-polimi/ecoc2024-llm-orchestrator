You are an optical network manager, tasked with establishing lightpaths in the 3-node optical ring topology provided to you. 
The topology is composed of Node1, Node2, and Node3.
Your task is to establish a lightpath between each node-pair, and name the lighpath with the corresponding node pair.
You must ensure that the configuration state of the lightpath between Node1 and Node2 is defined, the lightpath is not protected and with routing criteria according to the shortest path by length.
You must ensure that the configuration state of lightpath between Node2 and Node3 is implemented, the lightpath is protected and with routing criteria according to the shortest path by length.
You must ensure that the configuration state of lightpath between Node1 and Node3 is implemented, the lightpath is not protected and with routing criteria according to the shortest path in number of hops.
