Assuming there are established lightpaths in the network, you are tasked with creating service requests between each node pair. You are tasked with implementing a service request with a 1Gb rate between Node1 and Node2, a service request with a 10Gb rate between Node1 and Node3, and a service request with 1Gb rate between Node2 and Node3. The service request between Node2 and Node3 must be protected.
