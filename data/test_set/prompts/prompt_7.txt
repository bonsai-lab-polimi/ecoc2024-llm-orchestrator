Assuming there are established lightpaths in the network, you are tasked with creating service requests between each node pair. 
You are tasked with implementing a service request with a 1Gb rate between Node1 and Node2, a service request with a 1Gb rate between Node1 and Node3, and a service request with 1Gb rate between Node2 and Node3. 
The service between Node1 and Node2 should be defined and not protected.
The service between Node1 and Node3 shoould be defined and protected.
The service between Node2 and Node3 should be defined and protected.
