You must follow these rules:
1. A lightpath is associated to two optical nodes, a source node and a destination (sink) node. 
2. A service is associate to two optical nodes, a source node and a destination (sink) node. 
3. Each optical node has a unique name
4. Each lightpath has a unique name, and is associate to a unique identifier in the source node and a unique identifier in the destination node
5. Each service has a unique name, and is associate to a unique identifier in the source node and a unique identifier in the destination node
6. A service between a source and destination can be created, given that there is a lightpath associated between the same source and destination
7. The unique name of the lightpath should always follow this nomenclature "SourceNode-DestinationNode". For example, the lightpath between a node with name "NodeA" and a node with name "NodeB" will be "NodeA-NodeB"
8. The unique name of the service should always follow this nomenclature "s-SourceNode-DestinationNode". For example, the service between a node with name "NodeA" and a node with name "NodeB" will be "s-NodeA-NodeB"
9. The default configuration state for each lightpath and each service should be "implemented", unless stated otherwise
10. The default routing criteria for each lightpath and each service should be "byLength", unless stated otherwise
11. The default setting for the protection of each lightpath and each service should be "false", unless stated otherwise
12. Each lightpath is defined as "infrastructure" in terms of hierarchicalLevel
14. Each service is defined as "service" in terms of hierarchicalLevel
15. The default rate for a service is 1Gb
16. The default rate for a lightpath is otu2x, implying that the established lightpath is a non-coherent 10G lightpath
17.
